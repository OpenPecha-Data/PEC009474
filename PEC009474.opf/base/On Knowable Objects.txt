Treasury of Valid Reasoning

The definition

The definition of an object (yul) is that which can be known by the mind.

This has equal pervasion with: 1) a knowable object (shes bya), defined as “that which can be
taken as an object by the mind”; 2) an object of comprehension (gzhal bya), defined as “that
which can be comprehended by valid cognition”; 3) an established base (gzhi grub), defined
as “the observed object of a valid cognition”; 4) a definite existent (yod nges), defined
as “that which can be observed by a valid cognition”.

A. A division into four types, based on how they function as an object

1. Analysis of which phenomena become the four kinds of objects

All phenomena become the three types of objects, namely appearing object (snang yul), referent
object (zhen yul) and object of engagement ('jug yul), depending on their individual subject,
the mind. [On top of those], for the Sūtra Followers, the apprehended object (gzung
yul) corresponds exclusively to the five outer sense sources.[1] In the system of the Mind-Only
School there is no presentation of an apprehended object.

2. Analysis of which objects exist for each type of subject

All non-mistaken, non-conceptual consciousnesses have an appearing object. Mistaken non-conceptual
consciousnesses do not have one. All conceptual [consciousness] have an appearing object.

As for the apprehended object, only the two kinds of direct perception within object-awareness[2]
have one.

Factually concordant[3] conceptual cognitions have a referent object.

Objects of engagement exist for: 1) valid cognitions; 2) factually concordant sounds that are
means of expression,[4] and 3) persons.

3. The respective natures of each of the four objects

a) The appearing object

a.1) Definition

An appearing object is any object that appears, either by casting its own aspect, or directly
without an aspect.

a.2) Divisions

For the appearing object of a non-conceptual consciousness, those [appearing objects] that appear
by casting an aspect correspond to the realities[5] apprehended by a direct perception
of object-awareness,[6] whereas those that appear without casting an aspect correspond
to what is experienced in a direct perception of self-awareness.

The appearing object of a conceptual [consciousness] is an object generality (spyi don).

Alternatively, the appearing object, as a subdivision of the four types of objects, is not different
in substance with the consciousness that is the subject.

For the presentation of what appears at the same time, only three are given: 1. what is experienced
by a direct perception of self-awareness, 2. the non-existent clear appearance that
actually appears to a non-conceptual wrong consciousness, and 3. the object generality that
actually appears to a conceptual [consciousness].

As for the second of these [i.e., the non-existent clear appearance], I think that the intended
meaning of the Treasury of Valid Reasoning is that it is the appearing object of the consciousness,
but it is not generally [considered] to be an appearing object. [This is how
I] analyse this.

b) The apprehended object

The definition the apprehended object is: the outer object that actually casts an aspect similar
to itself upon the direct perception that apprehends it.

When subdivided in terms of the subject, there are 1) the apprehended objects of direct sense
perception, and 2) those of direct mental perception. In terms of the object, there are
five: forms, sounds, smells, tastes and textures.

c) The referent object

The definition of the referent object is: that of which one becomes aware, when the mind’s mode
of apprehension refers[7] to it by making it its principal focus.

These are divided into two [types]: the referent object of a conceptual valid cognition, and
the referent object of a determinate cognition.[8] The first is the [same as] the object
of engagement of a valid inference. For the second, the very same objects of engagement of
the two types of valid cognition [i.e., direct perception and inference] become the referent
objects of the determinate cognitions [subsequently] induced by those.

c) The object of engagement

The object of engagement is the main object that is the basis for a factually concordant subject[9]
to engage in an action.

When divided in terms of the subject, as we have already seen, there are three.[10]

First, the objects of engagement of valid cognitions are of two types: those of direct perception
and those of inference.

For direct perception, the object of engagement of a direct perception of object-awareness[11]
is the specifically characterized outer object. The object of engagement of a direct perception
of self-awareness is the specifically characterized consciousness. For the Sūtra
Followers, the object of engagement of a yogic direct perception is the specifically characterized
aggregates qualified by selflessness,[12] whereas for the Cognitive Awareness School[13]
it is the nature of reality (dharmatā) itself.

The object of engagement of an inference is classified as the proposition proven by a valid
reason.[14]

Second, there is the object of engagement of a sound. For example, the object of engagement
of the factually concordant sound “cow” is that specifically characterized cow.

[The object of engagement of a person is not explained.]

B. Division into two truths in terms of their natures

For the Particularist School, the definition of conventional truth is: that which, when it is
[physically] destroyed or mentally dissected, is no longer engaged in by the apprehending
mind. For example, when a vase is destroyed, the mind that would apprehend it can no longer
engage with it. And in the case of water, as is known to the world, if it is dissected
by the mind into the eight constituents of matter,[15] the mind that would apprehend [this
water] no can no longer engage with it.

The definition of ultimate truth is: that which can still be engaged in by the mind that apprehends
it, even if it is [physically] destroyed or mentally dissected, as in the example
of the form sense-source.[16]

As the Treasury of Abhidharma says:

Things which, when destroyed or mentally dissected,Can no longer be identified by the mind,Such
as pots or water, are relative.All else besides is ultimately existent.[17]

For the Sūtra Followers, the definitions of ultimate and conventional truth are, respectively,
those phenomena that are ultimately capable or incapable of performing a function, as indicated
by the statement: “the ultimate is that which can perform a function”.

For the Mind-Only School, the definition of conventional truth is: that which makes thorough
affliction[18] increase when one actually focuses on it; and the definition of ultimate truth
is: that which is pervaded by the increase of complete purification[19] when one actually
focuses on it.

As it is taught in the Compendium [of Abhidharma]: “If, when one focuses on a certain object,
thorough affliction proliferates, that object of focus exists conventionally. If, by focusing
on a certain object, complete purification grows, that object of focus exists ultimately.”

For the Middle Way School, the definition of ultimate truth is: that which is grasped by a mode
of apprehension that sees authentically, such as what is grasped by the mode of apprehension
of a noble being in meditative equipoise. And the definition of conventional truth
is: that which is grasped by a mode of apprehension that sees conventionally, such as the
actual object of the mind of an ordinary individual.

As it is taught in the Introduction to the Middle Way: “For all things two natures are apprehended:
one found through seeing their reality, and another found through seeing their deceptive
character. The object of the mind that sees reality is suchness [i.e., ultimate truth],
and that of the mind that sees deceptive entities is conventional truth.”[20]

C. Division into manifest and concealed, in terms of the object of engagement

1. Definitions

The definition [of a manifest object] is: that which is truly known without depending on an
object generality; and the definition [of a concealed object] is: that which is truly known
by means of an object generality.

2. Divisions

a. Manifest objects

Manifest [objects] are divided in terms of the object into 1) the phenomenal object (chos can),
and 2) its intrinsic nature (chos nyid). Phenomenal objects in turn are divided into [material]
things and consciousness.

In terms of the subject, they are divided into those [cognized] by a non-conceptual, non-mistaken
consciousness, and those [cognized] by a non-conceptual mistaken consciousness.

For [the non-mistaken case], 1) the manifest objects of direct perception of object-awareness
are the five objects [of the senses], such as form); 2) the manifest objects of direct perception
of self-awareness are all consciousnesses; and 3) the manifest object of yogic direct
perception is the nature of reality (dharmatā).

[For mistaken minds], there are such things as the two moons that are the manifest [object]
of a sense consciousness perceiving two moons.

b. Concealed objects

Concealed [objects] are divided in terms of the object, as before, into such things as 1) a
vase, which is concealed with respect to the conceptual [mind] that apprehends ‘vase’; 2)
the consciousness in one’s own continuum, which is concealed with respect to the mind of another
person who is not clairvoyant; and 3) the nature of reality, which is concealed for
ordinary individuals.

In terms of the subject, concealed objects are divided into [those cognized by] inferences and
[those cognized by] invalid [conceptual] minds.

For inferences, there are three types of concealed objects that are proved by the logical arguments
of 1) inference by the power of facts, 2) inference based on trust (yid ches), and
3) inference from what is commonly accepted.

For [invalid conceptual minds], there are the concealed objects of 1) determinate cognitions,
such as the [actual] blue which is concealed with respect to the ascertaining consciousness
induced by the sense direct perception apprehending [the colour] blue; 2) wrong consciousness,
such as the permanent sound which is concealed for the conceptual mind that apprehends
‘permanent sound’; and in the case of 3) doubt, the fact of sound actually being permanent
or impermanent (as the case may be) [is concealed] with respect to the manifest doubt
of the individual who harbours it.

Therefore, whatever is a manifest [object] of non-conceptual wrong consciousness is not necessarily
pervaded by being a manifest [object], and whatever is a concealed [object] of a wrong
conceptual consciousness is not necessarily pervaded by being a concealed [object]. The
reason for that is that the appearing object of a non-conceptual wrong consciousness is
not necessarily an existing [entity], and the same goes for the referent object of a conceptual
wrong consciousness.

In the case of doubt, the position that accords with reality is a concealed [object], but the
other one is not.

D. Division into specifically and generally [characterized objects], in terms of the mode of
engagement

1. Definitions

The definition [of a specifically characterized object] is: a thing (dngos po) that abides without
any mixing in place, time or nature; and [the definition of a generally characterized
object] is: a superimposition that appears as shared in terms of place, time or nature.

Alternatively, [they can be defined respectively] as “a thing that abides without being shared”
and “a superimposition that appears as shared.” As the Ascertainment of Valid Cognition
says: “as for the nature of a thing that abides without being shared, that is the specifically
characterized”. These two [definitions] are known from this quotation, [the first]
directly [and the second] indirectly.

2. Divisions

The specifically characterized are classified into two: [material] objects and consciousness.
Material objects are the five outer sense sources (forms, [sounds, smells, tastes and textures])
as well as the five inner sense sources (the eye, [ear, nose, tongue and body]).
Specifically characterized consciousness is divided into the six classes of consciousness
together with their accompanying [mental events].

For the earlier Tibetan scholars, the generally characterized are classified into the two of
1) isolates that are a non-implicative negation, and 2) generalities that are an elimination-of-other
done by a mind. However, in the authoritative text is it taught that there are
three [types] of generalities: those that depend on things, those that depend on non-things,
and those that depend on both, as shown by the statement: “since they depend on things,
non-things, or both, there are three kinds of generalities”.[21]

Otherwise, generalities can also be divided into four types: 1) those that separate that which
is singular into a multiplicity; 2) those that gather that which is multiple into something
singular; 3) those to which the singular appears as singular; and 4) those to which the
multiple appears as multiple.

Exclusions-of-other can be divided like this, because ‘generality’, ‘generally characterized’
and ‘exclusion-of-other’ share a single essential meaning.

E. Ultimately, all objects of comprehension are condensed into the specifically characterized
alone

Now, one may wonder what is the meaning of the teaching according to which the object of comprehension
is the specifically characterized alone, as in the statement “the specifically
characterized is the unique object of comprehension”.[22]

Generally speaking, in the textual tradition on logic, one first identifies the kind of valid
cognition that is known to all, whether they engage in philosophical tenets or not. Then
comes the point of proving that the Teacher [whose teaching is] similar to that [common valid
cognition] is a completely valid person, as shown by the statements on recognizing [valid
cognition] as “that which is non-deceiving and illuminates what was not known [before]”,
up to “the Bhagavan who is endowed with that [valid cognition] is a valid [person]”.[23]

What is meant by the “valid cognition that is known to all, whether they engage in philosophical
tenets or not”, is the cognition that becomes the cause for adopting objects that have
the power to bring benefit, and rejecting those that bring harm. This is taught by the quotation
from the Compendium of Valid Cognition: “Since securing what is beneficial and abandoning
what is harmful are necessarily preceded by an authentic cognition...”[24]

Furthermore, the objects that have the power to bring benefit and are adopted through this valid
cognition, and the objects that have the power to bring harm and are abandoned through
this valid cognition, are specifically characterized objects alone, because only specifically
characterized entities have the power to bring benefit or harm; the generally characterized
do not. This is shown by the quotations “since they bring the results of adopting
and abandoning, all beings engage in them,”[25] and “who would conceptually pursue that which
is not causally effective?”.[26]

The specifically characterized alone is both the apprehended object when one’s assessment operates
through direct perception of object-awareness, and the referent object when the assessment
is done through inference. Also, since the individual is not deceived when they engage
[with the object] on the basis of either of these two valid cognitions, [the specifically
characterized object] is also the object of engagement.

Considering this point, the auto-commentary on the Treasury of Valid Cognition says: “When the
specifically characterized is assessed directly, it is the apprehended object, and when
it is assessed as a concealed [object], it is the referent object. But in both cases, since
the individual who engages is not deceived, it is [also] the object of engagement.” Here,
“being assessed directly” has the same meaning as “being assessed as a manifest [object]”,
as we can know from the auxiliary word.[27]

In brief, regarding the specifically characterized alone, when one engages to assess it through
the two valid cognitions of direct perception and inference, in terms of the mode of engagement
there are two objects of comprehension—the specifically and the generally characterized.
But in terms of the object of engagement there is only one object of comprehension:
the specifically characterized. This is the unerring intention of [Dharmakīrti’s] statement:
“the specifically characterized is the unique object of comprehension”.[28]

As Devendrabuddhi writes: “Since only the specifically characterized is truly known either through
its own nature or through another nature, exactly two are posited: its own characteristics
just as they are, and the object of comprehension.”[29]
