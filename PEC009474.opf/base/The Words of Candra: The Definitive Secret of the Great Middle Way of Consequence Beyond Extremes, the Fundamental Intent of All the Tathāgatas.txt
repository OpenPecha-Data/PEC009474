The Definitive Secret of the Great Middle Way of Consequence Beyond Extremes, the Fundamental
Intent of All the Tathāgatas

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Homage to the guru and protector Mañjughoṣa!

Profound and beyond limiting extremes,The secret of all the buddhas’ wisdom mind,Deep, definitive,
concealed in the Perfection of Wisdom—The meaning of the Middle Way, I shall here describe.


Not complicated by elaborate constructs,Such as self, aggregates or ideation,And without concepts
or distinctions—The Middle Way path is beyond extremes.

Ourselves and others, seemingly real appearancesAre the great Middle Way of eightfold profundity:They
are unborn and do not cease,They do not abide, are not observed, do not come or
go,And transcend permanence and nihility.Immature folk who fail to realize thisCling to and
fixate upon the innate senseOf an “I” or self and thereby wander in saṃsāra,Since this causes
their afflictions to increase.

The heterodox with their mistaken opinions
Fabricate a singular, permanent self.

Some proponents of realismAssert a self that is identical in substance to the aggregates.This
is a baseless fabrication,So it is not a cause for wandering in existence,But is a mistaken
notion to be overcome through reasoning.Even if atoms or consciousness are said to be
real,In reality they lack any identity as singularOr as plural, and therefore lack true nature,Just
like a reflection.

Although phenomena are taught to be only mind,Mind itself has no true reality,And since it has
momentary partsIs devoid of any observable nature.

Thus, mind and what appears to itAre not established in reality.It might be claimed thatThe
dependent collections of consciousnessAre conditioned but that their natureIs self-illuminating
and truly established.But how is this existence known?It is experienced in apperception,
you say.Then there must be both experienced and experiencer.Otherwise, how could an experience
unfold?What is established is therefore dependence.True reality is a mental fabrication.


Some proponents of the Middle WaySpeak of existence on the relative levelAnd non-existence on
the ultimate level.But this would put the two truths in conflict,So it is not how things
actually are in truth.

Although we might conventionally referTo things arising from causes as ‘other-born’,Production
from other is unknown in the worldAnd is undermined by reasoning.

Some claim that to speak of the perfect dharmatāAs truly existent is borne outBy the actual
nature of how things are.But as meditative equipoise on the natural stateIs asserted to be
beyond thought and expression,Why would you claim that subsequent cognition is real?Were
it real it would have to be a real entity,And the dharmadhātu a thing with attributes.Why
cling to true establishment,When it necessarily involves such apprehension of signs.

There are some who apply reasoningAnd cling to nothing whatsoever.But if you were to claim that
non-existence is the ultimate,It would follow that the horns of a rabbit must be so.

Some say the conventional is established by valid cognition.To which we ask: what is it that
valid cognition establishes?If you say that it establishes merely that which appears,Then
that may be posited even without analysis.If you insist that it is posited based on analysis,Then
if the specifically characterized must be established through valid cognition,This
is a contradiction in terms,And since it is impure, relative, deluded conception,It could
not possibly be established through valid cognition.

Once these forms of contradictory and confusedMental analysis have been renounced,The unwholesome
notions in which there is clingingTo phenomena and individuals as having real identityAre
known as the innate conception of identity.Their apprehended objects, phenomena,And
apprehending minds are unborn,Primordially peaceful, equanimous,Sky-like, profound and unelaborate.This
is the reality of all things,The approach of the Middle Way beyond extremes.It
is this authentic and unchanging great equalityIn which the relative and ultimate have
neverBeen separable from the very beginningThat is called the Middle Way.

Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are by nature illusory,Emptiness and dependent origination inseparable—Indescribable,
inconceivable, inexpressible,Beyond the extremes of existence, non-existence,
both and neither.All designations and that which designatesAre equally lacking in even a
speck of true reality.Even the Middle Way is not an observable thing.It entirely transcends
thought, mind,And consciousness, and is without attributes.Perfectly seeing such perfectionIs
called seeing the natural state.But this is merely an expression;In reality there is
nothing to see—Non-seeing is itself great seeing.

The realization that all thingsAre utter peace, unborn,And that the mind too is unarisen,Is
termed seeing the dharmadhātu.

All phenomena of ground, path and fruitAre established to be by nature unborn.By settling within
that, just as it is,One attains the level of the four kāyas.

Through the force of the virtue gained by uttering this,May we escape the limitations of eternalism
and nihilismAnd realize the meaning of the profound Middle WayThat is the great secret
of all the buddhas!

Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö, who makes a path of his aspiration towards the great Middle Way, expressed
this according to the intent of Nāgārjuna and his heirs, who reached the level of Ārya,
on the first day of the kārttika month during the Water Sheep year (1943). May virtue and
excellence abound! Sarvadā maṅgalam.
