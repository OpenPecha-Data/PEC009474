The Vajra Mirror: Cutting through Doubts Concerning Self-Awareness

by Mipham Rinpoche

Namo Mañjuśrīye!

Those of little learning and no experienceBelieve that “self-awareness” in DzogchenOccupies
an inferior positionTo the Madhyamaka’s wisdom of equipoise.

Ah! You who presume to follow the Middle Way,Tell me: when remaining in the dharmadhātuDo you
believe mind is interrupted or not?If you say it is, then that’s perceptionless meditation.But
if you hold to the second option,Is it mind that experiences dharmatā or not?If not,
how is this true nature realized?If it is mind, then since dharmatāIs the nature of all
phenomena,Do things themselves appear without obstructionBefore the subjective mind or not?If
they do, how has dualistic perception faded?But if they don’t, yet in the absence of objectsThere
is so-called “experience” of the mind,What is it like? Can you put your finger
on it?If you claim that it is merely wisdom,Knowing itself individually, without separationBetween
object and subject,Such an experience is “self-awareness”.Therefore, to understand
self-awarenessAs the clear awareness of Mind Only,Or as a limited form of emptinessLacking
knowledge of external objects’ non-existenceIs talk unrelated to an experience of how
things are.The dharmadhātu, which is beyond conception,Is experienced individually and reflexivelyIn
space-like meditative equipoise.How is this a ‘limited’ nature?Mind Only believes
consciousness to be real.But here, self-awareness is great emptiness.In actual direct experience,
any rigid notionsOr concepts of true existence fall apart.Whoever experiences this
open space of unitySees the actual nature of all phenomena.For if each thing had its own
separate nature,There would be no end to all these natures.

Thus it is through the experiential approachOf settling meditatively in the space of unityThat
you can come to realize what would be the fruitOf many aeons of philosophical speculation.

hermitage of Karmo Taktsang.
