The Sword of Wisdom for Thoroughly Ascertaining Reality

by Mipham Rinpoche

1. You have not the slightest confusion about philosophy,And have completely abandoned every
fault,Your mind has no doubts about the three points—[1]Before Mañjuśrī, the treasure of
wisdom, I bow.

2. Profound, vast and difficult to realizeIs the nectar-like teaching of the sugatas—To those
who long to taste it,I here grant the light of intelligence.

3. The Dharma taught by the BuddhaDepends entirely upon the two levels of truth,The relative
truth of the mundaneAnd the truth of the ultimate meaning.[2]

4. If one is to apply an unerring and certain mindTo the nature of these two truths,One must
cultivate the excellent visionOf the two flawless valid cognitions.[3]

5. These appearances in all their rich varietyArise through dependent origination.Something
that is truly independent,Like a lotus in the sky, will not appear.

6. It is a complete gathering of causesThat functions to bring about an effect.All effects,
whatsoever they may be,Depend upon their own particular causes.

7. It is by knowing what is or is not the caseIn terms of causes and their effectsThat we pursue
one thing and avoid another,Whether in crafts or in philosophy—

8. They all have this as their starting point.This includes not only worldly disciplines,But
also the training that transcends the world.All phenomena, arisen in mutual dependence,

9. Naturally possess their own particularCharacteristics, which are uniquely theirs.The plain
and simple facts of the conventional—Solidity, fluidity, warmth and so on—are incontestable.


10. Even just a single thing has countless properties,And can be classified in infinite ways,Based
on affirmation and negation.These are natural features of the thing itself.

11. An object that is perceived clearly and directly,Has properties that seem separate and distinct,But
these distinctions are mental designations,Distinguished and engaged with by conceptual
mind.

12. Actual substance and what is imputed conceptually—These are two ways in which one can understandAll
that can be known, and many are the categoriesThat come from further elaborating
on these two.

13. Just so, they have their own causes, effects and natures,But when phenomena are investigated
authentically,That which brings about arising cannot be observed,Nor is there anything
that arises in dependence.

14. Each thing appears with its own identity,Yet is empty by its very nature,Absolute space
with threefold liberation,The very nature of the ultimate.

15. How something functions and how it dependsAre both aspects of its particular nature,So it
is with a thing’s nature that reasoning ends,And it would be futile to enquire any further.[4]

16. This kind of evaluation of things in their nature,According to each of the two levels of
reality,Is proven by the basic facts of how things are,So it is reasoning that establishes
what is tenable.

17. How things appear or how they ultimately abide,Can be known through perceiving their nature
directly,Or it can be inferred unerringly based onSomething else which is clearly apparent.


18. Direct perception itself is of four kinds:Unmistaken sensory, mental, self-awarenessAnd
yogic; all of which are non-conceptual,Since their objects appear with specific characteristics.


19. Without these direct perceptionsThere would be no evidence and hence no inference,And any
perception of things arising from causesAnd then ceasing would become impossible.

20. If that were the case, how could we everUnderstand them to be empty and so on?Without relying
upon the conventional,There can be no realization of the ultimate.[5]

21. Cognitions brought about by the five sensesClearly experience their own objects.Without
this direct sensory perception,Like blind folk, we would fail to see.

22. Mental direct perception arises from the faculty of mind,And clearly determines both outer
and inner objects.Without it, there would be no aspect of consciousnessCapable of perceiving
all types of phenomena.

23. Yogic direct perception is the culmination of meditationPractised properly and according
to the instructions.It clearly experiences its own objects, and without itThere would be
no vision of objects beyond the ordinary.

24. Just as this direct experience can eliminateMisperceptions about outer forms and the like,This
is also how it is within the mind itself,If there were some other knower, there would
be no end to them.

25. A mind that is cognizant and awareNaturally knows its objects, but at the same timeIs also
aware of itself, without relying upon something else,And this is what is termed ‘self-awareness’.

26. Any experience of the other direct perceptionsIs only determined to be actual direct perceptionBy
means of self-awareness; without thisThere would be no way of establishing it.

27. The root of inference lies in direct perception,And direct perception is determined by self-awareness.It
all comes down to the experience of an undeluded mind;There are no other
means of establishment beyond this.

28. Therefore, it is based on direct perceptions,Which are non-conceptual and undeluded,That
misperceptions of apparent phenomenaCan be decisively eliminated.

29. The conceptual mind is that whichConceives of objects by way of general images,Associating
them with names to form concepts,From which stem all manner of words and thoughts.

30. Even for someone unaware of the proper expression,[6]Generic images will appear in the mind,Ready
to be named, and through such concepts,Objects can still be pursued or avoided.[7]

31. Without this conceptual mind,There could be no conventions of affirmation or denial,And
it would be impossible to infer anythingOr communicate the points of training.

32. Conceptual thought enquires into and establishesThat which is not evident directly, such
as future pursuits.Without this ability to infer things conceptually,We would all become
like newborn babies.

33. A reason is information that allows us to know something else.[8]The reason must be a feature
of the subject,[9]And there must be positive and negative logical pervasion—[10]When
these three modes are present, there can be no delusion.

34. From a reason that is arrived at throughValid direct perception and valid inference,What
is hidden can be logically inferred,And things can be proven by means of relationship.

35. There are reasons that are results and natural reasons.[11]When a thing is not observed
or its opposite is seen,Something is negated for the reason that it cannot be observed—Like
this, there are three types of evidence in all.

36. From a genuine perspective, all appearancesAre now, and always have been, the same;And since
a pure mind sees only purity,Their nature remains entirely pure.

37. Real functioning things dependently arise,And what is unreal is dependently imputed;Therefore
both the real and the unrealAre empty by their very nature.

38. In the way things are, one cannot separateA thing which is empty from its own emptiness.So
appearance and emptiness are indivisibly united,This is inexpressible—one must know it
for oneself!

39. Any affirmation, whatsoever it may be,Must affirm either existence or identity;And any negation,
whatsoever it may be,Must negate either existence or identity.

40. Negations and affirmations based on what is validMay be set out definitively in the proper
way,And then, while remaining logically consistent,One can prove a point to others or make
a refutation.

41. When it comes to refutation, you can composeYour own syllogisms including all three modes,Or
you can state the consequences that followFrom the opponent’s very own assertions.

42. Within the conventional, there is that whichWe call ‘impure and narrow vision’ becauseReality
and appearances do not coincide,And a vision in which things are purely seen.

43. This makes two types of conventional validity,Like seeing with eyes that are human and divine.The
difference between the two lies in theirEssential natures, causes, results and functions.

44. One is an undeceived cognition of limited scope,That arises from a correct perception of
its object,Clearing misperceptions of things in a narrow field of vision,To bring a thorough
apprehension of a given object.

45. One is a pristine cognition of what is vast in nature,That arises from an observation of
precisely how things are,Clearing misperceptions of objects beyond the imagination,To bring
the result of wisdom that knows all there is.

46. The absolute as well has its two aspects:Categorized and uncategorized conceptually,And
then to evaluate them, two types of validityFor looking into what is ultimately true.

47. It is by relying on the former that one reaches the latter.Like impaired vision that is
healed and made pure,When the eye of valid cognition is fully developed,The truth of purity
and equalness can be seen.

48. It is because the mind, both with concepts and without,Is sometimes deluded—as when perceiving
two moons,Dreaming or believing a rope is a snake—[12] and sometimes not,That we have
the categories of valid and invalid cognition.

49. Without these categories of valid and invalid cognition,A clear separation between the deluded
and falseAnd the undeluded and true would be impossible,And the tenets of philosophy
could not be put forward.

50. When we investigate on the level of reality,In spite of all these conceptual elaborations,Based
on classifications such as direct perception,Inference, valid and invalid cognition
and so on,

51. All is empty by its very nature.And this natural simplicity itselfIs a feature of all conventional
constructs,Just as heat is a property of fire.

52. So it is that appearance and emptinessAre inseparable in all phenomenaAs the method and
its outcome,[13] which is whyYou cannot negate one and affirm the other.

53. “Without investigating what is and is not valid,But through mundane perception alone,Can
one enter into the ultimate?” you may ask.It is true that this is not ruled out.

54. Seeing how this thing is produced from that thingIs the direct perception of ordinary people,Based
on which they infer and make predictions—In fact, this is ‘pramāṇa’ in all but
name.

55. Without the two kinds of conventional valid cognition,Pure visions would seem false, and,
even for the impure,It would be unfeasible to say of a conch shell,“White is its true colour,
and yellow it is not.”

56. Without the two approaches to ultimate analysis,We would not know the unity of the two truths,The
ultimate would fall into conceptual extremes,And be a cause for its very own destruction.

57. The relative, that which is examined, is not real.So too the probing mind and self-awareness.When
we look, they are not there, like the moon in water—This is the ultimate indivisibility
of the two truths.

58. This is the one truth, nirvāṇa, the limit of reality,It is the ultimate state of all phenomena,Enlightened
being wherein knowing and known are inseparable,Pure wisdom experience,
without limit or centre.

59. Once the excellent eye of discriminating wisdomHas opened to the profound and vast like
this,One sees the noble path travelled byThe bliss-gone buddhas and their heirs,

60. Those enlightened beings of mighty intelligence.This is the way of the sūtra and mantra
vehicles,So difficult to find. When we have the opportunity,Let us not fail to gain the result!

61. Possessing in this way the four reasonings,And endowed with the light of intelligence,Let
us not be deceived by others, but investigateAnd be sure to follow the four reliances.

62. If we do not have this understanding,Then, like a blind man leaning on his staff,We can
rely on fame, mere words or what is easy to understand,And go against the logic of the four
reliances.

63. Therefore do not rely on individuals,But rely upon the Dharma.Freedom comes from the genuine
path that is taught,Not from the one who teaches it.

64. When the teachings are well presented,It does not matter what the speaker is like.Even the
bliss-gone buddhas themselvesAppear as butchers and such like to train disciples.

65. If he contradicts the Mahāyāna and so on,Then however eloquent a speaker may seem,He will
bring you no real benefit,Like a demon assuming Buddha’s form.

66. Whenever you study or contemplate the Dharma,Rely not on the words, but on their meaning.If
the point is understood, it matters littleHow eloquently or not the words were spoken.

67. Once you have understood what the speakerIntended to communicate, if you then continueTo
think about each word and expression,It is as if your elephant is found, yet still you search.

68. If you misinterpret the words they will only increase,And you’ll never stop till you run
out of thoughts,All the while straying further and further from the point.Like a child at
play, you’ll only end up exhausted.

69. Even for a single phrase like “Fetch the wood!”Out of context, there’s no end to what it
might mean.Yet if you understand what is meant,The need for the words ends just there.

70. When a finger points to the moon,The ignorant look at the finger itself.Fools, who are attached
to language alone,May think they understand, but it will not be easy.

71. When it comes to the meaning of what is taught,You should know the provisional and definitive,And
rely not on any provisional meaning,But only on the meaning that has certain truth.

72. The All-Knowing One himself, in all his wisdom,Taught in accord with students’ capacities
and intentions,Presenting vehicles of various levels,Just like the rungs of a ladder.

73. Wisely, he spoke with certain intentions in mind,As with the eight kinds of implied or indirect
instructions.If taken literally, these might be invalidated,But they were spoken for
specific reasons.

74. From the four schools of buddhist philosophyThrough to the ultimate vajra vehicle,Aspects
not fully realized by the lower approaches,Are made clear by those which are more advanced.

75. Seeing it to be superior according to the texts and logic,The intelligent seize the definitive
meaningLike a swan drawing milk from water,And revel in the ocean of buddhist teachings.

76. The teachings of the profound vajra vehicle are also sealedBy means of the six limits and
four modes.[14]But can be definitively established by stainless reasoning,Accompanied by
the pith instructions of the lineage.

77. The inseparable union of the primordial purityAnd great equalness of all phenomenaIs the
point that is definitively establishedBy the two authentic valid cognitions.

78. By applying the key points of the literal, general,Hidden and ultimate meaning, without
any conflictIn the approaches of the pāramitās, development phase,Completion phase and the
Great Perfection,

79. One gains the confidence of certainty about reality.Then the supremely intelligent heirs
of the buddhasCome to master an inexhaustible treasury of Dharma,As a sign of victory for
the teachings of scripture and realization.

80. When taking the definitive meaning into experience,Do not rely upon the ordinary dualistic
mindThat chases after words and concepts,But upon non-dual wisdom itself.

81. That which operates with conceptual ideas is the ordinary mind,Whose nature is dualistic,
involving ‘perceiver’ and ‘perceived’.All that it conceptualizes in this way is false,And
can never reach the actual nature of reality.

82. Any idea of something real or unreal, both or neither—Any such concept, however it’s conceived—is
still only a concept,And whatever ideas we hold in mind,They are still within the
domain of Māra.

83. This has been stated in the sūtras.It is not by any assertion or denialThat we will put
an end to concepts.But once we see without rejecting or affirming, there is freedom.

84. Although it is without any perceiving subject or object perceived,There is naturally occurring
wisdom that is aware of itself,And all ideas of existence, non-existence, both and
neither have ceased completely—This is said to be supreme primordial wisdom.

85. Just like the orb of the sun to someone blind since birth,This has never been seen by the
spiritually immature.However much they think about it, they fail to understand,And so it
is only a cause of fear in the minds of the foolish.

86. Yet through scriptures of authentic origin,Reasoning that refutes all four conceptual extremes,And
the force of the master’s practical instructions,It arises in our experience, like
sight that is restored.

87. At that time, with a faith that comes from savouringThe nectar-like taste of the Buddhadharma,Our
eyes open widely in purest joyAnd we glimpse the buddhas’ wisdom kāya.

88. In this, all things without exceptionAre seen in their ultimate state of equality,And with
this certainty about what is itself beyond expression,Skillfully, one expresses the unending
treasury of Dharma.

89. Having become learned in the ways of the two truths,When seeing the reality of their inseparable
unity,One knows that, just as a husk is removed to reveal the grain,All the various
methods are simply to lead one to this point.

90. With the thought, “Skilled in means are the buddhas,And all these methods make a genuine
path,”An irreversible sense of confidence will ariseIn the teachers and their teachings.

91. By gaining the supreme non-abiding wisdom,Naturally one is freed from the extremes of existence
and quiescence,And the ornament of great and effortless compassionArises to pervade
throughout the furthest reaches of space and time.

92. When the correct approach to the two truthsIs realized through contemplating the four reasoningsIn
this way, it brings the four genuine reliances.From such a supreme and flawless
cause as this

93. Comes the result of profound primordial wisdom.When this experience is developed to its
fullestIt releases the eight great treasures of confidence[15]That were sealed within the
absolute space of awareness.

94. Scriptures heard and contemplated in the pastAre never forgotten—this is the treasure of
recollection.Knowing precisely their profound and vast points—This is the treasure of intelligence.

95. Understanding all the themes of the sūtra and tantra collections—This is the treasure of
realization.Never forgetting any detail from one’s studies—This is the treasure of retention.

96. Satisfying all beings with excellent explanations—This is the treasure of confidence.Safeguarding
the precious treasury of sacred teachings—This is the treasure of Dharma.

97. Not severing the continuous line of the Three Jewels—This is the treasure of bodhicitta.Gaining
acceptance of the nature of equality beyond arising—This is the treasure of accomplishment.

98. Someone who has mastered these eight great inexhaustible treasuresWill never separate from
them, andWill be praised by the buddhas and their heirsAnd become a sovereign of the three
worlds.

99. The valid teachings of the victorious buddhasAre established by the valid cognitions,So
by developing confidence through the valid path,The true result of the valid teachings will
be seen.

100. With noble vision, completely and utterly pure,And great compassion that has reached perfection,The
bliss-gone buddha revealed the pathAnd said, “The taste of this nectar I have
discovered

101. Should be experienced by means ofThe four reasonings and the four reliances.”Although a
portion of this elixir has now been shared,In this modern age rife with degeneration,

102. Through all the methods that run counter to this approach,It is difficult to savour the
supreme taste of the teachings.With this in mind, and with an altruistic intentionAnd a mind
of supreme devotion for the teachings,

103. I have here briefly explained how to generateThe immaculate wisdom that is born of reflection.Through
the merit of this may all beingsBecome the very equal of Mañjuśrī!

104. Turned towards the sun of Mañjuśrī’s speech,The water-born lotus of my heart opens in devotion,May
these golden honey drops of excellent explanationBecome a plentiful feast for
the bees of good fortune!

I had had the intention to write this for a while, but in accord with the recent request made
by the learned scholar Lhaksam Gyaltsen, this was written in a single day by Jampal Gyepa
on the twenty-ninth of the third month of the Sakyong year (i.e., Wood Bird, 1885). Mangalam.
There are one hundred and four verses. Let virtue abound!
