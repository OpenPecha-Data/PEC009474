On the Yogācāra Treatises and Buddha Nature[1]

by Khenpo Shenpen Nangwa

The regent and great lord of the tenth bhūmi considered Jambudvīpa’s followers of the great
vehicle as a whole and imparted the so-called Five Treatises of Maitreya to Ārya Asaṅga:

The Ornament of Sūtras (Sūtrālaṃkāra) and the two Distinguishing (Vibhāga)[2] texts were taught
to guide the great vehicle’s adherents of Mind Only in accordance with the explanations
of the master and second buddha Vasubandhu. The Ornament of Realization (Abhisamayālaṃkāra)
of the Perfection of Wisdom (prajñāpāramitā) was taught to guide the great vehicle’s adherents
of Svātantrika. Thus, the commentaries of Ārya Vimuktisena and Haribhadra which explain
it according to the Mādhyamika Svātantrika are to the point. The Sublime Continuum
(Uttaratantra) was taught to guide the great vehicle’s adherents of Prāsaṅgika, in accordance
with Ārya Asaṅga’s own commentary, and is to be taken literally.

Ārya Asaṅga explained the meaning of the Mahāyāna sūtras in vast detail, on the basis of the
five treatises [of Maitreya], in the five sections on the levels (bhūmi):

he categorised and explained all the Mahāyāna sūtras according to the three precious collections
(piṭaka) in the Compendium of Topics (Vastusaṃgraha); he presented the modes of explaining
the words and meaning of the sūtras in the Compendium of Interpretation (Vyākhyānasaṃgrahaṇī);
he presented in elaborate detail how individuals accomplish all the stages of the
path in the Compendium of the Main Treatise on the Stages (Bahubhūmika/Bhūmivastu); and
he further resolved these in detail in the Compendium of Resolving (Viniścayasaṃgrahaṇī).[3]

In addition, he summarised all these points in two further compendia: the Compendium of Abhidharma
(Abhidharmasamuccaya), which is a summary of the common vehicles, and the Compendium
of the Great Vehicle (Mahāyānasaṁgraha), which is a summary of the uncommon Mahāyāna.

The followers of the Great Vehicle’s Mind Only School assert that the principal message of the
sūtras and great treatises, the dependent all-ground consciousness (ālayavijñāna), is empty
of self-nature in every respect. Texts such as the Sūtra of the Dense Array (Ghanavyūhasūtra)
say that “The universal ground of the various levels…etc.,”[4] and thus make the
point that the all-ground is the buddha nature (sugatagarbha). The Sublime Continuum also
says:

The disposition is empty of the adventitious stains,Which are characterised by their total separateness.But
it is not empty of the unsurpassed qualities,Which have the character of total
inseparability.[5]

And the Praise of Dharmadhātu [by Nāgārjuna] puts it like this:

The sūtras that reveal emptiness,However many the Victorious One taught,All counter the mental
afflictions;They do not diminish the disposition.[6]

Thus, the point that the buddha nature is not empty of its immaculate qualities, which are as
numerous as the sands of the River Ganges, derives from the sūtras, the writings of Ārya
Asaṅga, and the eloquent explanations of the protector Nāgārjuna. This means that although
all phenomena included within the categories of the aggregates, elements and sense sources
are determined to be empty by their very nature, as taught in the Middle Way, the immaculate
dharmas are unconditioned qualities, and to label such merely not non-nonexistent phenomena
as ‘not empty’ accords with the intent of the two great wayfinders.[7]

There is no limit to the particular assertions of others on this subject, so I shall not seek
to prove or refute them here.

These are the words of Shenpen.
