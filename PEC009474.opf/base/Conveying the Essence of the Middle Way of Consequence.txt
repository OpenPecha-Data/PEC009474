Conveying the Essence of the Middle Way of Consequence

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Noble and reverend Guru Mañjughoṣa,
Glorious Candrakīrti, I bow before you.

Of the various discerning explanations of your intentoffered by scholars here in Tibet,the direct
elucidation of the vision ofThe Introduction to the Middle Way[1]in the tradition of
the victorious Lobzang[2]uses reasoning to determine how phenomenaare beyond arising and
devoid of true existence.In this, a key point is that the so-calledself of the individualis
merely a mental projection,and apprehension of something autonomousupon the object is what
is negated.It is very important to be certain about thisand to determine the absence of
self.Unless you realize the absence of phenomenal identity,in particular, through this mode
of apprehension,you will be unable to subdue the enemy, afflictions.

When employing reasoning to determine the nature of all things,once you have put a stop to your
clinging to them as existent,generate certainty concerning emptiness and absence of existence,because
a lack of certainty will lead to mental blankness.

When the sequential extremesare eliminated all at once,then, in the unity of emptiness and interdependence,as
you realize how cause and effect dawn as emptinessand emptiness dawns as
cause and effect,in perfect unity beyond conflict,you will understand the profound meaning
of interdependence,which is the secret treasury of the Omniscient One.

Jampal Gawé Gocha wrote this in Darjeeling on the 28th day of Saga Dawa.[3] May virtue and excellence
abound!
